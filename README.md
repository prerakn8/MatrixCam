Developed by Prerak Naik, 2025.

This camera app, called MatrixCam developed by me, Prerak Naik, as a personal project. It is still under development.

The application uses the python language.

If you would like to download and run the application, download the .ZIP, and extract all to a folder of your choice. After that, you can run the python file, but before running the file, please read the paragraph below.

You can extract the exe in the latest release, and then run the program. This should work, as long as you have a camera configured and are using Windows.

This application allows you to see yourself in the Matrix. Instead of pixels, you become characters (letters, not virtual characters). It is surreal. When you blur your eyes, you can see the actual images. What is crazy is that somehow, the program can also emulate brightness, with the different characters. The overall logic is that there is a set list of characters to construct the image from, then the frames of the video or camera feed are resized to 80px by 45px to reduce lag, and then each pixel's intensity (the image is first converted to grayscale) is matched with those characters' intensity, giving us the images.

This application uses opencv, pyqt5, and other modules. You can use other video feed instead of the camera feed. 

You are allowed to use this project for the sole purpose of what it is intended for. You may not reverse engineer, copy, plagiarize, or relabel the project as your own.

If you think this is great, please look at my other projects on my Github page.
